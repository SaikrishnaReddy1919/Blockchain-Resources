# Blockchain-Resources

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this by adding more resources and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about new technologies and and their ecosystems. The main goal to create this repo is, while learning and reading about blockchain and the concepts around it, I have come across many things(pdfs, research papers, images etc...). I wanted all of them to be at one place and sharing this to other learners can also help them a lot. I will continue adding more resources to this repo in future. Keep an eye on this. 

### How to make a clean pull request
Look for a project's contribution instructions. If there are any, follow them.

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
- Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on - from ```master```, or create a new one.
- Add more resources or restructure the existing one, do something from which other can benifit from etc...
- Commit the changes.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
- From your fork, open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the branch that you have made changes.
- 
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

> And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit is.
